\abstract{  \OnePageChapter	% because it is very short

	Often the abstract will be long enough to require
	more than one page, in which case the macro
	``$\backslash$OnePageChapter'' should {\it not}
	be used.

	But this one isn't, so it should.
	}

\dedication[Dedication]{	% NEVER use \OnePageChapter here.
	To all of the fluffy kitties.
